### Still Pending
⏳ To Do:
1. Library Files:
   - github.ts: 'GitHubRepo', 'fetchPinnedRepos', 'fetchContributionStats' and their parameters
   - Status: Not yet accessible in current context

# Resolution Steps

1. Clean up remaining unused imports and variables:
   - Remove all identified unused imports
   - Remove or properly utilize declared variables
   - Clean up unused types and functions in library files

2. Ensure all components maintain their current functionality while implementing these fixes

Note: All changes will be made systematically while preserving the existing functionality. The ✅ marks indicate completed fixes.
